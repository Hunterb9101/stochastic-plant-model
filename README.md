# Stochastic Plant Model
## 1 Goals
The following goals were defined on December 2nd, 2020:

### 1.1 Is there a significant variation between the interactions of Sisymbrium Loeselii in native/non-native ranges?
The following table acts as a reference to what plants are invasive to what ranges (I=Invasive, N=Native).
| Plant | North America | Hungary | Germany | India |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sisymbrium loeselii (S)| I | N | N | I |
| Lupinus serriceus (LP)| N | I | I | I |
| Heterotheca villosa (HV)| N | I | I | I |
| Bochera holboellii (BH)| N | I | I | I |
| Pseduogneria spicata (PS)| N | I | I | I |
| Bromus tectorum (BT)| I | N | N | N |
| Papaver rhoeas (CM)| I | N | N | N |
| Lactuca serriola (LS)| I | N | N | N |
| Daucus carrota (VG)| I | N | N | N |

### 1.2 What is the future behavior of plants? 

## 2 Future Work
### 2.1 What effect does climate play on the future behavior of plants?
A 3D temperature surface could be added to the model, and data can be retrieved from online (Each location has temperature data online). 

### 2.2 Determine the effect of competition between S. Loeselii (an annual) and perennial plants. 
The framework is already implemented, but the RII competition script will likely need to be rewritten to add age as a factor.
